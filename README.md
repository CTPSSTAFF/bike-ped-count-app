# bike-ped-count-app
Bicylist/pedestrian traffic count app

This app was originally written by Ben Krepp circa 2009-2010. 

It was substantially rewritten by David Knudsen circa 2015. It was subsequently modifed to read data from a PostgreSQL data source (rather than an Oracle data source) by Ben Krepp in December 2017.

As it would be difficult (and enormously time consuming) to attempt to reconstruct the revision history of the first version, the code for the current working version of version 2 is being used to initialize this repo.
